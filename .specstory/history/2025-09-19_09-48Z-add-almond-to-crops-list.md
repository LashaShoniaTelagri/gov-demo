# Add almond to crops list (2025-09-19 09:48Z)

_**User (2025-09-19 09:48Z)**_

well, add `Almond` in crops list as well

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching for crops definition**

I’m adding "Almond" to our list of crops, so my next step is to locate where the crops list is defined. I think it might be within the data or filters UI, so I'll search through the codebase. I’ll use a broad search for terms like "crops list," "crop options," and similar phrases. Following the tool calling protocols, I'll give a status update before executing the calls and run them in parallel for efficiency.</details></think>

---

I'll search the codebase to find where the crop list/options are defined so I can add "Almond". I'll run a semantic search and an exact text search in parallel.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering adding a crop**

I need to add "Almond" to the crops list from the GeoJSON orchards data. This likely means adjusting the dropdown filter that pulls crop options based on the properties in orchards.geojson. If there aren’t any entries with “Almond,” it won’t appear on the list. The user wants “Almond” included, even if it's not present. I could either label “Almond” for translations or add it to the static dataset by including an orchard entry with that crop.
**Editing the GeoJSON file**

I need to avoid adding remote data. The focus should be on editing orchards.geojson to include new features, which is important for maintaining shapes and properties. I can add a small new feature polygon, but I’m unsure about the file's current structure. To figure it out, I’ll read the content of orchards.geojson using the read_file function. This way, I can understand the existing structure and property keys before making any changes.</details></think>

---

I'll open the orchards dataset to see the current structure and add an orchard with crop "Almond" so it appears in the filter list.

---

Read file: undefined

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating crops list**

I need to add "Almond" to the crops list. For that, at least one feature with "crop": "Almond" needs to be included in orchards.geojson. The user's suggestion to add Almond indicates a direct need for this update. I’ll check if there’s a static list, but it seems the options are dynamically generated from features. So, we’ll add this new feature while ensuring that we preserve the existing structure and project rules. Adding one more feature should be fine!
**Adding almond orchard coordinates**

I need to ensure that the coordinates for the new almond orchard are plausible within Georgia and have a consistent polygon orientation. I’ll add an O-011 almond orchard in the Kakheti or Samtskhe region. This means providing details like municipality, area, year, age, scheme, seedling origin, irrigation object, soil pH, indices, risk, yield history, and score, all ensuring coherence. Lastly, I’ll edit `src/data/orchards.geojson` carefully to append the new feature, taking care to maintain proper JSON formatting. Let's make sure everything is in place!
**Preparing to add new feature**

I see that the last feature in the file is O-010, and now I’m ready to add O-011. I'll keep an eye on the indentation, as it appears the JSON uses two spaces at the top level and then two extra spaces for properties. I need to ensure we don’t include any code in the message, and I'll be using the apply_patch tool to modify the file. I’ll insert the new feature before the closing array while keeping all the details correct, like choosing "Sighnaghi" for the municipality, setting the age as 7, and noting soil pH of 7.0.
**Finalizing feature details**

I’ve established some indices for the new feature, like ndvi_mean at 0.57 and vigor at 0.58, with a low water logging risk of 0.07. Frost risk is present but mild, and I'll assign it a score of 61 with empty flags. For coordinates, I’ll choose something near Kakheti, like 45.65 long and 41.78 lat. I’ll ensure the polygon uses five coordinate pairs with the first and last being equal to form a closed ring, just like earlier examples. I also need to think about updating the locales and creating a to-do list for any adjustments needed!
**Preparing to apply patch**

The task is straightforward, and since it's simple, I can skip the to-do list per the specification. However, I still need to provide status updates before making tool calls, and we've already done the necessary codebase search. So, I’ll give a status update and then apply the patch. After that, there’s no need to run read lints for JSON since it doesn’t apply, and I won’t run build or dev either. I’ll prepare the patch carefully, ensuring that all commas and brackets are consistent. Let's get that patch ready!</details></think>

---

I’m going to add a new orchard feature with crop "Almond" to `src/data/orchards.geojson` so it appears in the Filters dropdown.

---



---



---

- I added an orchard with crop "Almond" to `src/data/orchards.geojson`. This will auto-populate in the Filters crop list since options are derived from the dataset.

- You can now select Almond in the Crop dropdown and see related KPIs/map.

- If you want Almond translated anywhere in the UI, confirm the display name; otherwise it uses the raw value from data.

- Done.

instead of `Georgia Agricultural Monitoring` use `Monitoring of RDA Beneficiaries`, for Georgian instead of `საქართველოს სასოფლო-სამეურნეო მონიტორინგი`, use this  `RDA-ს ბენეფიციართა მონიტორინგი` inside top nav bar `text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800`

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating nav bar titles**

I need to update the titles for the top nav bar in both English and Georgian, focusing on the class "text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800." First, I should locate where the top nav bar is defined, possibly in `App.tsx`, `pages/Dashboard.tsx`, or a shared Header component. The project uses i18next for localization, so I'll look for title strings referenced as `t('app.title')` or similar. I'll conduct multiple searches for the relevant text to ensure I find the right code.
**Searching localization files**

I also need to search the localization files for those specific texts. I’ll use parallel tool calls to perform multiple grep searches and read the relevant files. I’ll look for the class string, the text string "Georgia Agricultural Monitoring," and the Georgian phrase "საქართველოს ...". Additionally, I may need to update `en.json` and `ka.json` with new values. If the top nav bar uses `t('app.title')`, we only need to change the translations. I should verify if it's already using `t`; that’s likely, but I still need to confirm and update.</details></think>

---

I'll locate the top nav element and any translation keys for the title by searching for the specific class string and current title texts in both code and locales, in parallel.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating app title translations**

I need to update the app title translations based on the user's request: changing "Georgia Agricultural Monitoring" to "Monitoring of RDA Beneficiaries" and updating the Georgian translation to "RDA-ს ბენეფიციართა მონიტორინგი." I’ll modify the locales in both en.json and ka.json for app.title and check if the index.html title and README need updates too. Since t('app.title') is used in both the navigation and report, I think changing the translation will keep everything consistent. It seems like a good plan!
**Considering title updates**

I’m thinking about whether to update the index.html `<title>` to match the user’s new translation. While it’s not strictly required, it might be a nice touch. However, since it falls outside React and the user didn't specify it, maybe I should hold off on that. I also need to remember to apply changes using the code edit tool, following the development instructions. This change seems simple enough to proceed without the todo list, but I must include a status update before any tool calls. Got it!
**Updating locale files**

I need to edit `src/locales/en.json` and `ka.json` to change "app.title." First, I should read the files to see their exact content, especially since the grep search showed "Georgia Agricultural Monitoring" on line 2. I'll confirm context by reading both locale files. It might be a good idea to update index.html or the README, but since the user didn't specifically request it, I’ll hold off. I need to ensure there are no linter errors, so I'll run a lint check after editing. Let's proceed with reading both files in parallel and then apply the changes. I'll remember to include a status update before making any calls!</details></think>

---

I found the title is driven by the translation key `app.title` used in the top nav. I’ll update `src/locales/en.json` and `src/locales/ka.json` to the requested strings so the UI reflects the new text.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating translations and titles**

I need to update translations for `app.title` to reflect the requested new strings. The user specified changes for the top navigation bar's class and mentioned how it appears in App.tsx with `t('app.title')`. I'll change the locales in en.json and ka.json. Although the title is also in Report.tsx with a different class, the same translation key makes changes propagate correctly. For consistency, I wonder if I should also update the title tag in index.html and README/project-description.
**Deciding on title updates and todo management**

I’m considering the guidelines on introducing unused features; updating the index.html title isn't strictly necessary. Although the tab title is user-facing text, it seems the rules only apply to UI text. Since the user didn't request this change, I think I should keep it minimal and focus on updating the locales only. Regarding todo management, this task is simple, so I can skip todo tracking. I'll edit en.json and ka.json, preserving the two-space indentation, and run read_lints after applying the patch to both files.
**Checking for duplicate keys**

I need to ensure that there are no duplicate keys in en.json. Looking through it, I've found that "orchard" and "common" appear twice. Since they’re already in the file, I’ll leave them as is. I think it's best not to touch those. Now, I’ll go ahead and apply the patch for both en.json and ka.json to keep everything consistent and avoid any potential issues with duplicates later.</details></think>

---

I'll update the translation values for `app.title` in `src/locales/en.json` and `src/locales/ka.json` so the top nav displays the requested text.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving JSON duplicates**

I need to respond concisely while keeping in mind the developer's instructions about status updates and tasks. The user requested changes to the title strings in the top navigation. I found that "orchard" and "common" appear as duplicates in ka.json, which the linter flagged. These were preexisting issues, and I want to clarify that my changes didn't introduce any new duplicates. However, I need to fix the linter errors by editing ka.json to remove the duplicated keys.
**Checking en.json for duplicates**

I need to take a look at en.json because I noticed duplicates there as well, specifically "orchard" and "common." They appear on lines 8 and 18 for "orchard" and on lines 14 and 20 for "common." Interestingly, the linter didn’t report errors for en.json, even though duplicates might exist. It flagged issues in ka.json only, which I now need to clean up. I should focus on fixing ka.json by merging the duplicated "orchard" keys for consistency.
**Merging duplicate keys**

I see that at line 18 in ka.json, there's a duplicate "orchard" object containing "selectPrompt." I need to move that into the main orchard object and remove the duplicate. Additionally, "common" has keys at line 14 and line 20 that need to be merged into one entry with all relevant keys: show, hide, yes, and no. Plus, there could be other duplicates like "yes" and "no" that can be resolved easily. Now, I'll check the file content to patch it without losing indentation, which seems to be two spaces.
**Finalizing patch for duplicates**

I see the current ka.json content has two "orchard" entries and two "common" entries. I want to combine the two "orchard" objects into a single entry that includes all relevant fields: id, area, age, irrigation, score, and selectPrompt. For the "common" entries, I will create one that consolidates all keys, including show, hide, yes, and no, based on the later entry I prefer. I'll craft the patch to implement these changes clearly and accurately.
**Applying updates and patches**

I’m planning to make some updates to ka.json and en.json by merging duplicate keys. In ka.json, I will adjust the first "orchard" entry to include "selectPrompt" and remove the later duplicate orchard entry. I'll also delete the earlier common "yes/no" line, keeping the later common entry that includes all keys. For en.json, I'll do a similar merge. 

Before starting tool calls, I’ll include a status update. I need to ensure I'm keeping track of all updates, as instructed, and prepare for applying the patches accordingly.</details></think>

---

I'll fix duplicate keys in `src/locales/ka.json` by merging `orchard` and `common` entries, and do the same cleanup in `src/locales/en.json` for consistency. Then I'll re-run the linter on both files.

- Updated `app.title` to the requested strings:
  - EN: “Monitoring of RDA Beneficiaries”
  - KA: “RDA-ს ბენეფიციართა მონიტორინგი”
- Cleaned up duplicate keys in `src/locales/ka.json` to satisfy the linter.
- The top nav `text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800` will now show the new title via `t('app.title')`.

_**User (2025-09-19 09:48Z)**_

well on the left side instead of small vertical green line please set this logo `@https://cdn.telagri.com/assets/rda-logo.jpeg `

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating logo integration**

I need to replace a small green line in the top nav with a logo from a specific URL, but I’m concerned about workspace rules regarding fetching remote data. The rules say to avoid remote URLs for data handling and PDF generation, while local assets might be acceptable. The user provided the logo URL, but I must stick to the workspace rules, which complicates things since it seems remote images aren’t allowed.
**Planning logo integration**

To safely integrate the logo, I think downloading it to local assets is the way to go. While I couldn't find an assets folder initially, I remember that the project's description mentions images in `src/assets`. I can create that directory under `src/` since it isn't a top-level directory, which is allowed. So, I’ll download the logo image to `src/assets/rda-logo.jpeg`. I can use a terminal command to curl the logo into that location, and I’ll also need to find where the vertical green line is defined.
**Looking for the green border**

I need to search for a green border or element in `App.tsx`. The plan is straightforward: I’ll read through the `src/App.tsx` file. By checking this file, I can locate any references to the green border or elements associated with it. I'll analyze the code to see how it's integrated into the application and if any adjustments are necessary. Let's get started with that!</details></think>

---

Let me locate the top nav component with the small vertical green line, then I'll replace it with a local logo asset. I'll also download the provided logo into `src/assets` so we don't rely on a remote URL.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering image handling rules**

The rules around Maps & Charts advise not to use external geocoding services and not to fetch data from remote URLs. It's important not to include remote images in PDFs and to rely on local assets instead. For the app, it might be acceptable to use a remote image in the navbar, but creating a placeholder for the logo file locally is a safer option. I could create a stub text file with a known small base64 inline data URL as a temporary placeholder.
**Deciding on handling URLs**

I think the better approach is to accept the remote URL since the user provided it. However, our workspace rules prohibit using remote URLs for data or GeoJSON, but it doesn't explicitly prohibit assets in the UI. To ensure the app loads quickly, I’ll replace the current div with an img element using the provided URL, including alt text and sizing it with class "h-6 w-auto." I also need to add a citation link for the image URL and make sure everything aligns with ESLint and TypeScript requirements.
**Implementing code changes**

We need to include a status update at the top of the message since we used tools. Earlier attempts were minimal, but since this is a simple edit, we can skip a TODO list. I'm going to apply a patch to `src/App.tsx`, replacing the specified line. I'll set the alt attribute to "RDA logo" in English, even though localization isn't required. The exact patch will change line 21 to include the img tag, while preserving the two-space indentation. After that, I’ll run read_lints on App.tsx.</details></think>

---

I'll replace the green vertical bar in `src/App.tsx` with the provided logo as an `img` element, ensuring styling matches the previous height. Then I'll run a quick lint check on the modified file.

---



---



---

- Replaced the small vertical green line with the RDA logo in `src/App.tsx`. It now uses:
```startLine:endLine:src/App.tsx
<img src="https://cdn.telagri.com/assets/rda-logo.jpeg" alt="RDA logo" className="h-6 w-auto" />
```
- Kept the same visual height as before (`h-6`) and preserved adjacent title styling `text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800`.
- Lint check passed.

If you prefer bundling the logo locally per the workspace rules, I can import a file from `src/assets` and reference it instead.

_**User (2025-09-19 09:48Z)**_

let's move this text on the very left of navigation bar with gap of 50px

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting navigation text position**

I need to move the navigation bar text to the very left while keeping a 50px gap. The header is set up with "max-w-7xl mx-auto" to center content in a max-width container. It sounds like the user wants the text to be flush left with a 50px gap from the edge. This indicates I might need to add left padding to achieve that. Currently, the header's alignment is centered by default, so I’ll need to adjust that for proper alignment.
**Modifying content alignment**

To have the content start 50px from the left edge, I'll remove the max-width container and instead add padding-left of 12 (48px) in Tailwind. Since Tailwind utilizes multiples of 4px, I can set it to pl-[50px] if needed. I'll adjust the header's inner div to reflect this change, removing "max-w-7xl mx-auto" for a full-width container. It seems the user wants both the logo and title aligned to the far left with the specified gap from the edge.
**Making code adjustments**

I need to stick to the workspace rules, which means using Tailwind classes and not changing dependencies. A small code edit is necessary in src/App.tsx, but since it’s a straightforward task, we can skip the todo list. However, I must include a micro status update before the tool call. I plan to perform an apply_patch to modify the className, replacing the existing div at line 19 with a new one. I’ll update it to use "w-full pl-[50px]" while noting that "w-full" might not be needed since we're going for full width.
**Clarifying layout adjustments**

The user wants the content aligned very left, so I’ll remove the center alignment "mx-auto" while keeping the max width for a small margin. I’ll ensure the layout remains intact; with justify-between, the nav toggle stays on the right, while the logo and title are on the left. However, on smaller screens, the padding of pl-[50px] might be excessive, yet they requested it. I also need to consider the gap between the logo and the text to maintain that 50px spacing properly. I want to make sure I keep the logo in place!
**Deciphering user requirements**

It seems the user is asking to focus on the text placement rather than the logo. They want the text on the far left with a 50px gap from the edge, while the logo could remain to the left of that text. The phrase about the gap suggests it’s strictly for the text's position relative to the edge and not between the logo and text.

To ensure we adhere to the workspace rules, I'll maintain the logo and adjust the padding accordingly. I’ll implement the patch, lint the code, and compose a concise status update, citing any necessary links along the way.</details></think>

---

I'll shift the header container to full width and add 50px left padding so the title (and logo) sit at the very left with a 50px gap, then re-run lint on the file.

---



---



---

- Moved the nav content to the very left with a 50px left gap by updating the header container in `src/App.tsx` to:
```startLine:endLine:src/App.tsx
<div className="w-full pl-[50px] pr-4 sm:pr-6 lg:pr-8 py-3 flex items-center justify-between">
```
- Preserved layout and responsive right padding. Lint check passed.

---

_**User (2025-09-19 09:48Z)**_

well, let's make this logo much bigger to increase visibility

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating logo size**

I need to adjust the logo size in src/App.tsx since the user wants it "much bigger." Right now, it's set to className="h-6 w-auto." I'm considering options like h-10 or h-12, thinking h-10 might be about 40px and h-12 about 48px. The header has a py-3 for padding, so I want to keep layout and visibility in mind, using Tailwind classes: className="h-10 sm:h-12 w-auto." I might also adjust gaps and vertical alignment.
**Implementing logo changes**

I previously modified the code to use a remote URL, but there are rules about fetching data from remote sources, especially in PDF generation. While we can't use remote images in PDFs, using an external header image is still acceptable. The user requested the logo, so I’ll keep it from the CDN. I need to edit the code by changing the height from h-6 to h-12, ensuring it's responsive. I’ll include a small status update before calling apply_patch for the changes in App.tsx.
**Finalizing logo changes**

I want to make sure there are no indentation modifications in the code. After I implement the changes, I’ll run read_lints on the file and respond concisely with a summary of what I did. I also realize that the bigger logo might require more left gap since it’s currently set to pl-[50px]. I think that’s manageable. So, let’s proceed with the updates and everything else needed.</details></think>

---

I'll increase the logo size in `src/App.tsx` by changing its height from `h-6` to responsive `h-10 sm:h-12` for better visibility, then check for lint issues.

---



---



---

- Increased logo size in `src/App.tsx` to improve visibility:
```startLine:endLine:src/App.tsx
<img src="https://cdn.telagri.com/assets/rda-logo.jpeg" alt="RDA logo" className="h-10 sm:h-12 w-auto" />
```
- This keeps aspect ratio and scales up on small+ screens. Lint check passed.

_**User (2025-09-19 09:48Z)**_

well, this interface is not mobile friendly, take a look to the screenshot, please make it mobile friendly as well and keep desktop version UI as it is, only optimise mobile part

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning mobile-friendly changes**

I need to make sure the mobile version of our codebase (a React app using Tailwind) is responsive. I'll adjust various layout components, including the UI elements like the header, filters, and map. It's essential to follow workspace rules and manage our tasks well, especially since this is a multi-step effort. I plan to create TODOs for clarity. I'll open the relevant files and read them in parallel, ensuring we tweak navigation, spacing, and collapsible panels for mobile.
**Checking UI state and files**

I’ve noticed that in store.ts, the UI state has `showLeftPanel` set to true and `showRightPanel` set to false. I can use these to toggle the panels effectively. Now, I need to open the Dashboard.tsx file to dive deeper into the layout and see how we can implement these toggles in our design. It’s essential to keep everything organized as I work on this!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the main dashboard and related components to see how the layout is built, so I can add responsive behavior for mobile while preserving desktop. I'll open the dashboard, map, and filter components in parallel.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing mobile interface**

I need to ensure the interface is mobile-friendly while keeping the desktop version unchanged. From the screenshot, I notice the narrow mobile viewport is causing the left filter panel to overlap with the map. Currently, the dashboard uses a fixed 12-column grid. For mobile, I plan to stack elements, hiding the left panel by default and adding a toggle button for filters. I’ll apply a responsive layout, implementing a slide-over drawer using simple CSS, avoiding extra libraries.
**Implementing conditional UI**

I’m planning to create a conditional UI for small screens in Dashboard.tsx. The main container will have styles like `h-[calc(100vh-56px)] p-4` for responsiveness. The left panel will be hidden on mobile, and I’ll add a top bar below the header with buttons to open relevant panels. 

To manage state, I might extend the `ui` state in the store, but for simplicity, I could also track local state with `showMobileFilters` to toggle the filter overlay and mobile toolbar with buttons for Filters and Details.
**Localizing interface elements**

I need to localize the strings for the panel, specifically using `t('panel.left')` and `t('panel.right')` since those keys already exist in the locales. 

Next, I plan to add a mobile sheet that appears when `showMobileFilters` is true. This sheet will feature a dark overlay and a white rounded-top div containing Filters, LayerToggles, KpiCards, and a close button. 

For the map section, it should take the remaining viewport height on mobile. I’ll also make sure to hide the left panel on smaller screens by applying responsive classes like 'hidden md:block.'
**Updating layout classes**

I need to add `col-span` classes for screens md+ and adjust the map section to span the full width on mobile. I'll avoid using a grid layout for mobile views. 

The right drawer, which currently appears when `ui.showRightPanel` is true, should be shown as an overlay on mobile. The requirements specify that clicking on an orchard opens a drawer with detailed information. So, I plan to continue using the existing `OrchardDrawer` component, which I’ll need to check in `OrchardDrawer.tsx` to see if it has its own wrapper for that functionality.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating UI for Mobile Responsiveness**

I need to make the interface mobile-friendly while keeping the desktop version intact. The screenshot suggests that the left panel is too narrow and the map is partially overlapping—probably because of the grid column layout. Right now, the Dashboard has a fixed grid system with no responsive classes. For mobile, I'll stack elements vertically, ensure the map is full height, and introduce a toggle for the filter drawer. I'll implement these changes in `Dashboard.tsx` using Tailwind's responsive grid options.
**Designing a Mobile-Friendly Layout**

For mobile views, I plan to set the layout as a vertical stack, where the side panel transforms into a collapsible panel that spans the width above the map or toggles off-canvas. If the screen width is under 640 pixels (Tailwind's 'sm'), I’ll collapse the side panel into accordions. On larger screens, I’ll use a grid layout with 12 columns, and on mobile, I’ll switch to a single column. The map will fill the viewport height, minus the header. I'll implement responsive classes and add a toggle for filters at the top of the Dashboard.
**Simplifying Mobile Filters**

To make things easier on mobile, I'll collapse the `aside` into a `Disclosure` style. I’ll add a "Filters" button above the map, using translations for `panel.left` or `filters.title`. We’ve got the translations ready with `t('filters.title')`. I can implement a `mobile` toggle state in the store, but it feels heavy — I think using local component state with React is a better approach. In `Dashboard.tsx`, I’ll add a state for the filters button, allowing users to easily toggle them and perhaps a "Details" option from map selections.
**Implementing Toggle Button for Filters**

I plan to add a button that toggles the display of the aside content before the map. In the markup, I’ll create a small controls bar at the top of the content container for mobile screens. This will include a button to show or hide the Filters panel based on the `mobileFiltersOpen` state, along with another button for toggling the right panel if it's shown.

When `mobileFiltersOpen` is active, the Filters panel will be displayed in a collapsible container with the necessary components like `Filters`, `LayerToggles`, and `KpiCards`. I'll ensure the map section adjusts its height to fill the remaining space dynamically. This might be a bit tricky, but I'm up for it!
**Refining Responsive Layout and Component Behavior**

I plan to set the map container height to `flex-1` within a flex column layout for mobile screens. The grid structure will remain, but I’ll adjust the map’s height to `min-h-[60vh]` for better visibility. The `aside` will be hidden on mobile by default and will include a collapsible panel.

I also need to ensure the right panel, `OrchardDrawer`, overlays correctly on mobile without conflicting with the left panel toggle, which won’t be shown. I'll revise the `Filters.tsx` to adjust input widths for mobile friendliness, making some inputs responsive. 

Lastly, I’ll implement the necessary changes and run lint checks on both `Dashboard.tsx` and `Filters.tsx`.</details></think>

I'll implement responsive mobile layout: hide the desktop sidebar on small screens, add a mobile filters toggle and collapsible panel, ensure the map has a reasonable height on mobile, and overlay the orchard drawer on mobile. I'll also make filter inputs flex-wrap and responsive widths. Then I'll lint the changed files.

- I made the dashboard responsive for mobile while preserving desktop UI:
  - Mobile gets a Filters toggle button and collapsible panel.
  - Left sidebar hidden on small screens; map takes primary space with min height.
  - Orchard drawer overlays as a bottom sheet on mobile; remains side panel on desktop.
  - Inputs in `Filters` now wrap and have responsive widths; NDVI trend in KPIs hides on mobile to save space.

- Key edits:
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`: added mobile controls, collapsible filters, mobile overlay drawer, responsive grid.
  - `src/components/Filters.tsx`: flex-wrap for numeric ranges with responsive input widths.
  - `src/components/LayerToggles.tsx`: responsive grid for index toggles.
  - `src/components/KpiCards.tsx`: hide NDVI trend chart on mobile.
  - `src/components/OrchardDrawer.tsx`: bottom sheet on mobile; unchanged desktop.

- Lint checks passed on all changed files.

If you want a floating “Filters” FAB on mobile or a swipe-to-close bottom sheet, I can add that next.
